# Final Project for COP 1000

This project is broken up into two parts:

1. [Scoping](#scoping)
2. [Implementation](#implementation)

You may work by yourself, or with one other person for this project. If you decide to work with another person, you must indicate that during the scoping phase.

### About The Final Project Repository

The final project repository housed here will maintain conversations about the project. Additionally, you'll create a branch on this repository that will house your project submission via a Pull Request, as we've done in past projects.

## Scoping

Your goals for the scoping phase of the final project should be:

- narrow down the topic of your final project
- create a proposal for your final project
- solicit feedback from classmates
- get final approval üëç from instructor
- provide feedback to classmates on their proposal
- create a rough design of your final project

### :bangbang: Scoping Deliverables

To get 100% on the scoping phase, you must:

:ballot_box_with_check: Create an [Issue](https://github.com/cop1000/final-project/issues/new) in this repository with your project proposal.
  * The **Issue** will automatically populate with some fields for you to fill in. Answer the questions that autopopulate.
  * If you're working with another student, say so in this issue. Only one deliverable is required per team.
  * Feel free to add comments about what you'd like some feedback from classmates or the professor on.

:ballot_box_with_check: Provide feedback to **Issues** opened by your classmates. **You need to provide feedback to at least 3 classmates for credit.** Some useful feedback would be:
  * does the project seem like too much work to be done in 1 week? If not, how could you suggest the project be modified so it fits into the given timeframe?
  * what obstacles might your classmate have missed?
  * does the project utilize topics learned throughout the semester?
  * does your classmate describe a general plan for achieving his/her desired project? the plan could be an outline, diagram, drawing, written description of programming structure, pseudocode, etc.

:ballot_box_with_check: Keep an eye on your notifications so that you can continue conversations on your own **Issue** but also on the **Issues** in which you have given feedback. When you receive a :+1: from the professor, you can begin implementing.

## Implementation

Your goals for the implementation phase should be:

- finalize your design from the scoping phase
- implement your final project (this is the coding portion!)
- solicit feedback from classmates
- provide feedback to classmates

### :bangbang: Implementation Deliverables

To get 100% on the implementation phase, you must:

:ballot_box_with_check: Clone the `final-project` repository to your machine. This will download a copy of the repo to your computer so you can begin adding files. Just like we've done in previous projects.

:ballot_box_with_check: Create a branch on this repository. Ensure the branch includes your username, for example `hectorsector-final-project` is a valid branch name, `final` is NOT a valid branch name.

:ballot_box_with_check: Formalize the design you discussed in the scoping phase by adding one or more files to the `design` folder. These files can be outlines, diagrams, written descriptions of programming structure, pseudocode, or anything that helps you plan out **BEFORE** you begin coding.

:ballot_box_with_check: Add your program to the `devel` folder.

:ballot_box_with_check: Update the `README.md` file in your `devel` folder explaining, in detail, how to run your program. Instructions are in the starter file I placed in the `devel` folder.

:ballot_box_with_check: Once finished, commit any final changes like you've done for previous projects, and sync your changes up to GitHub.

:ballot_box_with_check: Create a pull request to turn in this assignment. In your pull request, include questions you'd like your classmates to give you feedback on. If you're creating the Pull Request on GitHub.com, the `base` branch should be `master` and the `compare` branch should be the branch you created.

:ballot_box_with_check: Give feedback to your classmates via the [open pull requests page](https://github.com/cop1000/final-project/pulls). **You need to provide feedback to at least 3 classmates for credit.** Some useful feedback would be:
  * Does the classmate's project run on your computer? Don't be afraid to ask for help if it doesn't, this is a learning experience for both you and the other student.
  * What did you like the most about the project?
  * Is there something that you think the other student could change about the project to make it easier to use, or to improve the quality of the project?
  * Do you yourself understand the concepts the student implemented? You can ask questions as part of the open pull request if you do not.
  * If you'd like to get someone's attention, at-mention them by using the @ symbol and their username (like @hectorsector, for example)
  * Be a cheerleader for your classmates and provide :sparkles:

:ballot_box_with_check: Monitor your own open pull request for feedback from other classmates or the instructor. Incorporate the feedback. When the instructor closes your pull request, you can consider yourself finished. But don't be afraid to introduce new changes or continue the conversation!
